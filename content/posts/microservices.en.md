## MicroService

- Take every app function and put it in its own service
- Runs in its own container
- Communicate via APIs

### Pros
- Flexibility (each microservice can be built in different languages/technologies)
- Less risk in change
- Independent scaling
- Faster release cycles

## Monolith
- Server-side systme based on single application 

### Pros
- Good for small team
- Less complex
- Less duplication
- Run fast


### Cons
- Highly dependent (single point of failure)
- Language/Framework
- Growth
- Scaling issue
- Complex deployment

### Architecture 
```
Limits Microservice     Microservice X      Microservice Y
```
