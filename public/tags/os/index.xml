    <description><![CDATA[Thread vs Process What is a Thread, really? Short answer:
Thread is a subset of a process Longer answer:
Thread is an independent set of values for CPU registers Detailed answer:
A thread is an execution context for CPU, which is all the information CPU needs to execute instructions. Essentially: More about thread
Thread components: Program counter: keeps track of which instruc­tion to execute next Stack: which contains the execution history Registers: which hold its current working variables Example: A single thread could be displaying the current tab you’re in, and a different thread could be another tab.]]></description>
