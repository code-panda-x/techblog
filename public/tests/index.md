# All About Testing


## Different Testing Concepts

- Unit testing: test the smallest piece of code
- Integration testing: test if different components work together
- System testing: test every component of an application to make sure that they work as a complete and unified whole
- Smoke testing: ensure that the critical functions of the program are working
- Regression testing: determine if code modifications break an application
- Performance testing: examines the speed, stability, reliability, scalability, and resource usage of a software application under a specified workload
- Load testing: determines how the software application behaves while being accessed by multiple users simultaneously
- Stress testing: tests beyond normal operational capacity to test the results

## More

- White box testing: **Know** code and structure of the product to be tested and uses that knowledge to perform the tests
- Black box testing: **Does not know** its internal functioning
