So we invent ways to make it easier on ourselves to visualize the workings of the computer. One way of doing this is to analogize those on and off signals as the numbers 1 and 0. This thinking of it in terms of binary numbers ","date":"2022-01-30","objectID":"/how-data-are-stored/:1:0","tags":["How"],"title":"How Data Are Stored","uri":"/how-data-are-stored/"},{"categories":["General Tech"],"content":"Dig into the Machine code Machine code, to the actual circuitry, isn’t numbers or values. Machine code is a bunch of voltage gates that are either open or closed, and depending on what they’re connected to, a certain light will flicker at a certain time etc. The “machine code” dictates the pathway and timing for specific electrical signals that will travel to reach their overall destination. So for 010101, 3 voltage gates are closed (The 0’s), 3 are open (The 1’s) 010101 would be easy instructions for a simple circuit, but how does a complex computer process all of the information? x-Bit-processors tell how many bits the processor can process at once. A bit is either 1 or 0, “On” or “Off”, “Open” or “Closed” so 32-bit processors process “10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010” - this many bits at once. A processor is an “integrated circuit”, which is like a compact circuit board, containing resistors/capacitors/transistors and some memory. I’m not sure if processors have resistors but I know you’ll usually find a ton of them located around the actual processor on the circuit board Anyways, a transistor is a switch so if it receives a 1, it sends current in one direction, or if it receives a 0, it’ll send current in a different direction… (or something like that) So I imagine that as machine code goes… the segment of code the processor receives changes the voltage channels in such a way that it sends a signal to another part of the computer (why do you think processors have so many pins?), probably another integrated circuit more specialized to a specific task. That integrated circuit then receives a chunk of code, let’s say 2 to 4 bits 01 or 1100 or something, which further defines where the final destination of the signal will end up, which might be straight back to the processor, or possibly to some output device. Machine code is a very efficient way of taking a circuit and connecting it to a lightbulb, and then taking that lightbulb out of the circuit and switching the circuit over to a different lightbulb Memory in a computer is highly necessary because otherwise to get your computer to do anything, you would need to type out everything (in machine code). Instead, all of the 1’s and 0’s are stored inside some storage device, either a spinning hard disk with a magnetic head pin that ‘reads’ 1’s or 0’s based on the charge of the disk, or a flash memory device that uses a series of transistors, where sending a voltage through elicits 1’s and 0’s (I’m not fully aware how flash memory works) Fortunately, someone took the time to think up a different base number system for programming (hex), and a way to compile those numbers (translate them) back into binary. And then all software programs have branched out from there. Each key on the keyboard creates a specific signal in binary that translates to a bunch of switches being turned on or off using certain voltages, so that a current could be run through the specific individual pixels on your screen that create “1” or “0” or “F”, or all the characters of this post. So I wonder, how does a program ‘program’, or ‘make’ the computer ‘do’ something… Rather, how does a compiler compile a program of a code different from binary? It’s hard to think about now because I’m extremely tired (so I won’t try) but also because EVERYTHING you do on a computer is because of some program. There are actively running programs (processes) in task manager. These keep your computer screen looking the way you’ve become accustomed, and also allow for the screen to be manipulated as if to say the pictures on the screen were real-life objects. (They aren’t, they’re just pictures, even your mouse cursor) (Ok I’m done. enough editing and elongating my thoughts, it’s time for bed) Also, what I don’t really get is how 0’s are ‘read’ by the computer. It seems that a ‘0’ must not be a ’lack of voltage’, rather, it must be some other type of signal Where perhaps something like 1 volt = 1, and 0.5 volts = 0.

A modem is your gateway to the internet—a cable, fiber optic, or telephone line comes through your neighborhood, to your house, and connects to your modem. The modem translates the digital 1s and 0s from your computer into analog information for the cable or telephone wire to carry out to the world, and translates incoming analog signals in the same way. This is called modulation and demodulation, respectively, and it’s where the “mo-dem” gets its name. A modem is a device that connects your home, usually through a coax cable connection, to your Internet service provider (ISP), like Xfinity. The modem takes signals from your ISP and translates them into signals your local devices can use, and vice versa. The connection between your house and the Internet is known as a wide area network (WAN). Each modem has an assigned public IP address that identifies it on the Internet. A router connects all your home’s devices to each other—through Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi—and then connects to the modem. It gives each device its own internal IP address, which it uses to route traffic between them. If your modem’s IP address is like the street address of a building, your router’s internal IP addresses are like apartment numbers. Your modem receives information from the internet, sends it to the router, and the router sends it to the computer that asked for it. (That way, your phone doesn’t receive the cat videos you asked for on your laptop.) The network created by your router is known as a local area network, or LAN, and it connects you to a larger wide area network, or WAN. In most home cases, your WAN is, for all intents and purposes, the internet. Your router: Assigns a local IP address to each device on the network Creates a firewall to prevent security breaches Manages the traffic on your network Handles any Parental Controls A wireless access point connects to your router, usually over Ethernet, and communicates with your Ethernet-less devices over wireless frequencies. Most home users have routers with wireless access points built in, but standalone access points are still common for businesses, since you can pair multiple access points together to extend your network over a large area. All routers come with built-in Ethernet ports, but depending on the size and class of router you buy, you may not have enough to plug in all your devices—especially in the age of smart home tech, which often require numerous, hard-wired base stations. If you run out of Ethernet ports on your router, a switch can add more Ethernet ports to your network. You just plug your extra devices into the switch, plug the switch into your router, and they’ll appear on your network. Note that you need a router in order to use a switch. A switch can’t assign IP addresses or create a network like your router can—it merely acts as a traffic cop for the signals coming through. ref https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/modem-router-and-access-point-whats-the-difference https://www.xfinity.com/hub/internet/modem-vs-router#:~:text=Modems%20bring%20the%20Internet%20to,can%20use%2C%20and%20vice%20versa. https://medium.com/@syakirharis25/modem-vs-gateway-vs-router-and-its-security-considerations-d853de8b4b31 ","date":"2022-01-25","objectID":"/network-connection/:1:0","tags":["Network"],"title":"Modem vs Router vs Access Point vs Switch","uri":"/network-connection/"},{"categories":["General Tech"],"content":"Collection of file","date":"2022-01-11","objectID":"/what-is-file/","tags":["What is"],"title":"What is File","uri":"/what-is-file/"},{"categories":["General Tech"],"content":"Executable files (.exe) An executable file is a type of computer file that runs a program when it is opened.
